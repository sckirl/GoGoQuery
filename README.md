This is a comprehensive e-commerce desktop application that allows users to browse, search, and filter a wide range of items for sale. The platform supports user registration with two distinct roles: sellers and customers. Sellers can add new items, manage stock levels, and update delivery statuses. Customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and place orders seamlessly.

The application features an attractive and user-friendly interface designed using JavaFX, ensuring a smooth and modern user experience. The layout is intuitive, with responsive navigation and clear visual hierarchy to enhance usability.

All data interactions, including user information, product listings, orders, and deliveries, are efficiently managed using a MySQL database management system (DBMS). This ensures data integrity, security, and scalability for real-world usage.
